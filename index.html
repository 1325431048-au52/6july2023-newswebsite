    <img src="image\1.jpg">
    <p>The Supreme Court of India has rejected the demand regarding the constitution of the National Menâ€™s Commission and even asked the petitioner that you are presenting a one-sided picture. But this basic question was not even discussed as to why there is a need to even file this type of petition. The petition also referred to suicides committed by men due to domestic disputes.</p>

        US ready to help in Manipur if asked, says Garcetti; 'Never heard statement of this nature': Cong leader
    </h1>
    <img src="image/2.jpg">
    <p>On a question pertaining to Manipur violence, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti who was in Kolkata on Thursday said the US is ready to assist in any way if asked to resolve the crisis and the northeast can't prosper without peace. Noting that this is an internal matter of India, Eric Garcetti said the US does not have any strategic concerns but it has human concerns. The comment drew a response from Congress MP Manish Tewari who said it is very rare for a US envoy to make a statement "of this nature about the internal affairs of India".</p>
